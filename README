This repository contains version control related tools developed for use at
Virtualmeet.net <http://virtualmeet.net>, a site dedicated to arranging online
strength competitions.

These tools have been made to fit into a Git and PostgreSQL world as that's
what we use, but they could fairly trivially be extended to work with other
setups. If there is interest out there to further generalize them get in
touch... or better yet, send me a pull request.

Currently the tools consists of the following:

1) DATABASE VERSIONING: A shell script for changeset based PostgreSQL database
   versioning.

2) [ secret - to be added shortly ]
