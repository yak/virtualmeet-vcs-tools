This repository contains version control related tools developed for use at
[Virtualmeet.net](http://virtualmeet.net/), a site dedicated to arranging
online strength competitions. Good to go for any project, feedback welcome.

These tools have been made to fit into a [Git](http://git-scm.com/) and
[PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/) world as that's what we use, but they
could fairly trivially be extended to work with other setups. If there is
interest out there to further generalize them get in touch... or better yet,
send me a pull request.

The tools
---------

 1.     **PostgreSQL Database Versioning:** A shell script for changeset based database
        versioning. *Status: works, take it out for a ride.*

 2.     **Git Stats:** Yet another Git stats tool written in PHP. Designed to support
        multiple repositories and to separate tracking of in-house and third-party
        code. *Status: work in progress, check it out if you dare.*



*TODO: should come up with some snappy names for these projects. :)*
